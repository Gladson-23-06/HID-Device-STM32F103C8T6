# STM32 USB HID Keyboard Implementation

## Overview
This project provides an implementation of a USB Human Interface Device (HID) using the STM32 microcontroller. It enables the STM32 board to function as a USB keyboard, allowing for basic keyboard interactions across various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac.

## Features
- USB HID configuration for STM32 microcontrollers.
- Simulates standard keyboard inputs.
- Cross-platform compatibility.
- Example code for keystroke generation and USB communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- STM32 development board (e.g., STM32F103C8T6).
- STM32CubeIDE.
- USB cable for interfacing with the host computer.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. **Unzip the HID.zip File:**
   Extract the `HID.zip` file to access the project files, including source code and USB HID configurations.

### How to Use

1. Open the project in STM32CubeIDE or your preferred IDE.
2. Connect your STM32 board to the host computer using a USB cable.
3. Compile and flash the code to your STM32 board.
4. Once flashed, the board should be recognized as a USB keyboard by the host system.

## File Structure
- **main.c**: Contains the main logic for USB HID keyboard implementation.
- **USB.c / USB.h**: Handles USB communication and HID descriptor definitions.
- **keyboard_Report_Descriptor.h**: Defines the report descriptor for the HID keyboard.

## Next Steps
- Add more complex keyboard functionalities.
- Improve compatibility across different operating systems.
- Optimize code for faster execution and memory efficiency.
